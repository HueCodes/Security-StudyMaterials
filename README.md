## My Thoughts
- Test was easy overall, acronyms really important, multiple choice is helpful, Udemy cource was a solid stepping stone but definitely not necessary. I studied probably 25-30 hours and had an intermediate amount of knowledge coming into it. The free study guide of reddit was helpful and you can probably do fine with just free resources.
