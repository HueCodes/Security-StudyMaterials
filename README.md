Welcome to my personal study repository for the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification! This repo serves as a centralized hub for my notes, resources, practice materials, and progress tracking as I prepare for the exam. Whether you're also studying for Security+ or just curious about cybersecurity fundamentals, feel free to browse, fork, or contribute.

## Overview
The CompTIA Security+ certification validates baseline skills in core security functions, including threat detection, risk management, cryptography, and compliance. My goal is to pass the exam by [insert target date, e.g., Q4 2025] and document my journey here.

This repo includes:
- **Study Notes**: Concise summaries of key domains.
- **Practice Questions**: Curated quizzes and exam simulations.
- **Resources**: Links to books, videos, and tools.
- **Progress Tracker**: My study schedule and milestones.

## My Thoughts
- Test was easy overall, acronyms really important, multiple choice is helpful, Udemy cource was a solid stepping stone but definitely not necessary. I studied probably 25-30 hours and had an intermediate amount of knowledge coming into it. The free study guide of reddit was helpful and you can probably do fine with just free resources.
